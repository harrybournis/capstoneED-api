# Takes a hash of questions, and saves them in the database.
# Called after the successuful creation of a PaForm.
# Checks whether the text of a question already exists
# in the database, and if it doesn't it creates a new
# record for the particular lecturer.
#
# This action is encapsulated in this service since it
# can get more advanced and complicated in the future.
# It currently simply checks the text of equality,
# alhtough the checks could become smarter in the future
# through the use of fuzzy text matching. Î‘ question
# may also acquire more attributes and relations in the
# future, so keeping its creation logic encapsulated within
# this class makes sense.
