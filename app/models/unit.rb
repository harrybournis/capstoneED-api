# A Unit contains multiple Assignments, each of which contains Projects.
# To use the system, a Lecturer has to first create a Unit.
# For identification, a Unit contains a name, a year and a semester,
# as well as a 'code', which is the identifier of the Unit within
# the university. Î‘ Unit can be archived by the lecturer, after it has
# been completed and there is not reason for them to see it on their dashboard.
# Archiving a Unit will set the archived_at date, which will exclude the unit
# from being included in the GET /units endpoint. Instead, the Unit can
# be found in the GET /units/archived endpoint.
#
# A Unit has an association with a Department, which is also created by
# the Lecturer. By default, the Department will be included with the
# Unit when it is serialized.
#
# @!attribute name
#   @return [String] The name of the Unit
#
# @!attribute code
#   @return [String] A code that identifies the Unit within the University.
#     No presumptions are made about the format of this code, and no limitations
#     are placed on the input string.
#
# @!attribute year
#   @return [Integer] The year that the Unit takes place.
#
# @!attribute semeseter
#   @return [String] The academic semester that the Unit takes place. Usually
#     this is 'autumn' or 'spring', although no limitations are placed on the input.
#
# @!attribute archived_at
#   @return [Date] The date that the Unit was archived. If it is null, then the
#     Unit is supposed to be active. Currently, there is no way to 'unarchive' a
#     Unit.
#
# @!attribute [r] lecturer_id
#   @return [Integer] The id of the Lecturer that created the Unit. This attribute
#     can not be changed by the user.
#
# @!attribute department_id
#   @return [Integer] The id of the Department that the Unit belongs to.
